# Sign-Language-Recognition-For-Mute-And-Deaf

A computer vision-based sign language recognition system using Machine Learning models, Python, and OpenCV. The system accurately recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real time, enabling efficient communication for newly deaf/mute individuals. By training the model on a comprehensive dataset, we ensure rapid and precise conversion of ASL gestures into text, promoting inclusivity. Thorough testing proves the system works well in different situations, connecting people with and without disabilities and promoting an inclusive society.
