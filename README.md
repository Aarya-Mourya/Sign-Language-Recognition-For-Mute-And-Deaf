# Sign-Language-Recognition-For-Mute-And-Deaf

Developed an American Sign Language Recognition System for Mute and Deaf that accurately recognizes the 26 alphabets. Utilizing Python, OpenCV, and Google's Mediapipe library for hand landmark detection, I was able to capture precise hand movements. The system leverages Matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for numerical computations. By implementing a Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-learn, I achieved a classification accuracy where 100% of the samples were correctly identified. This project showcases the integration of advanced machine learning techniques and computer vision to create an effective communication tool for the mute and deaf community.

## Features

#### 1. Real-time Hand Detection and Tracking
- **Use of Mediapipe**: Employs Googleâ€™s Mediapipe library to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time, providing accurate and efficient hand gesture recognition.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Utilizes OpenCV for capturing video feed from the webcam, ensuring seamless integration with the Mediapipe hand detection module.

#### 2. High-Accuracy Classification
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Implemented using Scikit-learn, the classifier was trained to recognize 26 ASL alphabets with 100% accuracy on the test samples.
- **Feature Extraction**: Hand landmarks captured by Mediapipe are processed to extract relevant features for accurate classification.

#### 3. User-Friendly Interface
- **Live Feedback**: Displays the recognized alphabet on the screen in real-time, providing immediate feedback to the user.
- **Visualization Tools**: Utilizes Matplotlib to visualize hand landmarks and recognition results, aiding in better understanding and debugging of the system.

#### 4. Data Handling and Processing
- **NumPy for Computations**: Leverages NumPy for efficient numerical computations and data handling.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implements data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training dataset, improving the robustness of the classifier.

#### 5. Robustness and Scalability
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Developed to run on multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Designed with a modular approach, allowing easy updates and integration of additional features or improvements.
