Developed an American Sign Language Recognition System for Mute and Deaf that accurately recognizes the 26 alphabets. Utilizing Python, OpenCV, and Google's Mediapipe library for hand landmark detection, I was able to capture precise hand movements. The system leverages Matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for numerical computations. By implementing a Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-learn, I achieved a classification accuracy where 100% of the samples were correctly identified. This project showcases the integration of advanced machine learning techniques and computer vision to create an effective communication tool for the mute and deaf community.
